                            Pusarla Venkata Sindhu (born 5 July 1995) is an Indian professional badminton player. 
                            She became the first Indian woman to win an Olympic silver medal, and one of the two 
                            Indian badminton players to ever win an Olympic medal – the other being Saina Nehwal. 
                            Sindhu won silver in Women's singles at Commonwealth Games 2018. She was also a silver 
                            medalist at the 2017 BWF World Championships and 2018 BWF World Championships consecutively. 
                            She was also a silver medalist in Asian Games 2018, which were held in Indonesia.

                        <p>
                            Sindhu came to international attention when she broke into the top 20 of the BWF World 
                            Ranking in September 2012 at the age of 17. In 2013, she became the first ever Indian women's 
                            singles player to win a medal at the Badminton World Championships. In March 2015, she is the 
                            recipient of India's fourth highest civilian honor, the Padma Shri. Her silver medal win in the 
                            women's singles event of the 2016 Summer Olympics made her the first Indian shuttler to reach 
                            the final of an Olympics badminton event and the youngest Indian to make a podium finish in an 
                            individual event at the Olympics. She is among the top five shuttlers in women's singles category. 
                            In 2018, She became the first Indian to have clinched the World Tour title defeating Japan's 
                            Nozomi Okuhara in the 2018 World Tour final.

                    <h4> Early life </h4>
                    <article>
                        <p>
                            Pusarla Venkata Sindhu was born in Hyderabad to P. V. Ramana and P. Vijaya. Both her parents 
                            have been national level volleyball players. Her father, Ramana, who was a member of the 
                            Indian volleyball team that won the bronze medal in 1986 Seoul Asian Games, received the Arjuna 
                            Award in 2000 for his contribution to the sports. She has an elder sister, P. V. Divya, who 
                            was a national-level handball player. However, she was not interested in pursuing professional 
                            sports and became a doctor.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            P.V.Sindhu lives in Hyderabad. Though her parents played professional volleyball, Sindhu 
                            choose badminton over it because she drew inspiration from the success of Pullela Gopichand, 
                            the 2001 All England Open Badminton Champion. She eventually started playing badminton from 
                            the age of eight. Sindhu first learned the basics of the sport with the guidance of Mehboob Ali 
                            at the badminton courts of Indian Railway Institute of Signal Engineering and Telecommunications 
                            in Secunderabad. Soon after, she joined Pullela Gopichand's Gopichand Badminton Academy.

                        <p>
                            Gopichand seconded this correspondent's opinion when he said that "the most striking feature 
                            in Sindhu's game is her attitude and the never-say-die spirit." After joining Gopichand's 
                            badminton academy, Sindhu won several titles. In the under-10 years category, she won the 
                            5th Servo All India ranking championship in the doubles category and the singles title at the 
                            Ambuja Cement All India ranking. In the under-13 years category, Sindhu won the singles title 
                            at the Sub-juniors in Pondicherry, doubles titles at the Krishna Khaitan All India Tournament, 
                            IOC All India Ranking, the Sub-Junior Nationals and the All India Ranking in Pune. 
                            She also won the under-14 team gold medal at the 51st National School Games in India.

                            which she lost to Michelle Li of Canada. PV Sindhu later created history by becoming the first Indian 
                            to win two back-to-back medals in the BWF World Badminton Championships after her bronze medal finish 
                            in 2014 BWF World Championships held in Denmark. Sindhu defeated Wang Shixian in three sets 19–21, 21–19, 
                            21–15, with the match lasting more than an hour. She had earlier defeated Bae Yeon-ju in the third round 
                            with 19–21, 22–20, and 25–23. However, she lost to the eventual gold medalist, Carolina Marin, 
                            in straight sets and had to settle with bronze medal together with Minatsu Mitani. 
                        </p>
                        <h4> 2016 </h4>
                        <p> 
                            In January, Sindhu won the Malaysia Masters Grand Prix Gold women's singles title after beating Scotland's 
                            Kirsty Gilmour in the final. She had also won this tournament in 2013. In the 2016 Premier Badminton league, 
                            Sindhu was the captain of Chennai Smashers team. In the group league, she won all of the five matches to help 
                            her team qualify for the semifinal and won the tournament against Mumbai Rockets. At the women's singles 
                            event, Sindhu was drawn with Hungarian Laura Sárosi and Canadian Michelle Li in Group M. During the group 
                            stage matches, she beat Laura Sárosi (2–0) and Michelle Li (2–1). Further she ousted Chinese Taipei's Tai 
                            Tzu-ying (2–0) in the round of 16 to meet the second seed Wang Yihan in the quarterfinals, whom she defeated 
                            in straight sets. Sindhu later faced the Japanese Nozomi Okuhara in the semifinals, won in straight sets, 
                            and ensuring her a podium finish. This set the stage for her final showdown with top seed from Spain, Carolina Marín. 
                            Marin managed to beat Sindhu in three sets in the 83-minute match. With that result, Sindhu clinched the silver medal. 
                            She charted history of achieving the feat as she is youngest and first female individual to bag an Olympic
                             Silver medal representing India. This was the second instance of podium finish at the Olympics by any Indian badminton player.
